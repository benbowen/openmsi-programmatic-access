Interactive notebooks + examples can be downloaded by cloning! 

* [**Chapter 1: Getting Started**](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/BenBowen/openmsi-programmatic-access/master/Chapter1/Chapter1_GettingStarted.ipynb)
    Introduction to the methods available and described. Examples include:
    - Plotting a spectra for a location
    - Showing an image for a range of m/z
    
* [**Chapter 2: Digging into the data**](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/BenBowen/openmsi-programmatic-access/master/Chapter2/Chapter2_DiggingIntoTheData.ipynb)
    Description of some frequently used analysis. Examples include:
    - Averaging spectra for a region around a position
    - Plotting a difference spectrum
    - Image analysis of two different ions
    
* [**Chapter 3: Adding an analysis**](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/BenBowen/openmsi-programmatic-access/master/Chapter3/Chapter3_AddingAnAnalysis.ipynb)
    Adding one of the OpenMSI analysis entries to a file. Examples include:
    - TIC normalization
    - Factorizations
    - Clustering
    
* [**Chapter 4: Matrix Factorizations**](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/BenBowen/openmsi-programmatic-access/master/Chapter4/Chapter4_MatrixFactorizations.ipynb)
    Because matrix factorizations are so widespread in spectral analysis, a chapter is dedicated to them.  Examples include:
    - Calculation of the CX/CUR factorization from the full SVD
    
* [**Chapter 5: Describing an Experiment**](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/BenBowen/openmsi-programmatic-access/master/Chapter5/Chapter5_DescribingAnExperiment.ipynb)
    Adding metadata describing samples, experiments, and instrumentation.  Examples include:
    - Get a file's metadata
    - Edit a file's metadata
    
* [**Chapter 6: Hilbert Space Filling Curve**](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/BenBowen/openmsi-programmatic-access/master/Chapter6/Chapter6_HilbertSpaceFillingCurve.ipynb)
    Alternate visualization of dense spectra. Examples include:
    - Comparing the spectra at two locations
    
* [**Chapter 7: Access to private data**](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/BenBowen/openmsi-programmatic-access/master/Chapter7/.ipynb)
    A quick tutorial on how to authenticate and login. Examples include:
    - logging in
